An app for disaster management

Natural disasters are becoming more frequent, growing more severe and affecting more people than ever before. We need more help than before. During a calamity, the first thing that a person does is to inform particular authorities or an SOS call. But most of the times the place is far away from the nearest authorities so, the authorities don’t reach in time.
Also, we take animals for granted during natural calamities and just leave them on their own but, animals are also an essential part of the ecosystem so they also need protection.

## Modelling and Simulation

As new approach towards increasing the preparedness for a natural calamity we will be simulating a flashflood scenario in virtual reality to give an immersive feel of the flash flood. Well be building it using Unity Engine and Visual Studio and VR packages.
The First Step of Natural Disaster- Precaution
The very first layer protection from any calamity is a precaution. First, our app will notify about various natural disasters and keep the person updated with the details of the said disaster and this will happen persistently. And the data will be based on forecasts by the meteorological department. The second step would be creating awareness about the precautionary steps to be followed prior to the calamity.

## During a Disaster

The first thing after a disaster strikes is to notify the Disaster Management Authorities but it is better to be prepared. When a disaster is about to occur, our app will pre-notify the authorities so, that they can be prepared beforehand.

## Rescuing stranded people

If a person is stranded at a place during a disaster such as fire or earthquake where the person cannot escape without help. For this situation, our app will notify the authorities for that person. As the authorities may not be able to reach there on time so the app will send help notification to police personal or nearby pedestrians or drivers. The person willing to help will have to accept the help request and he will be shown a list of steps to follow. This way the person will have a higher survival probability until the authorities arrive. 

## Post Natural Disaster

During a disaster, there is a scarcity of food so the govt. sets up relief camps but the people affected are not aware of these camps. Since the disaster camps are already set up prior to the calamity our main focus, post the disaster would be speeding up the relief process. We will be implementing homing beacons based upon the victims’ GPS coordinates.  We will also market the locations of nearest relief camps. In addition to that easily accessible crowdfunding links, contacts of all NGOs, schedule of the aid collection and transport will be put up. The highlight of the application will be the lost and found feature which will help the people get in touch with their friends who were also lost during the calamity by linking to their names in the list if there is.

## Fauna assistance

We will link the security cameras in the area of the disaster (say national parks, roads etc.) which will locate a trapped animal using computer vision and notify the concerned authority immediately so that animals can also be rescued.

## Method of prediction of disaster

Many disaster predictions will be made by our app such as for earthquake can be taken from USGS Earthquake Catalog, Cyclone and Floods will come from the AerisWeather API.
